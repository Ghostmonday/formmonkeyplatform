"""
Type Consistency Checker for FormMonkey

This utility helps identify duplicated types across the codebase and
ensures consistency between TypeScript and Python implementations.

Usage:
    python type_checker.py

This will:
1. Scan the codebase for duplicate type definitions
2. Verify field parity between TS interfaces and Python models
3. Check validation rule consistency
4. Generate a report of issues to address
