/**
Claude, define schema and runtime validators here.

Goals:
- Validate Master Profile structures
- Validate parsed field values (e.g., correct email format)
- Cross-field rules (e.g., startDate must precede endDate)
- Use Zod or a portable validation lib

Dependencies & Integration:
- Used by backend/routers/profile.py for profile validation before persistence
- Imported by frontend/src/pages/Profile.tsx for real-time form validation
- Referenced by backend/services/master_profile.py for data integrity checks
- Used by frontend/src/components/FieldEditor.tsx for field-level validation
- Imported by backend/routers/parse.py for parsed field validation
- Referenced by shared/types.ts for type-safe validation schemas
- Used by backend/services/ai_assistance.py for PII detection and redaction

Validation Architecture:
- Schema definitions using Zod for runtime type checking
- Cross-platform validation (works in both Node.js and browser)
- Composable validators for complex business rules
- Error reporting with field-specific messages and internationalization support
- Performance optimization for large-scale validation

Output:
- Typed validator functions (e.g., validateProfile(profile): Result<Valid, Errors>)
- These validators must be usable in both backend (input validation) and frontend (form checking)
