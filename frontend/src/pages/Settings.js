You're working on the Export Page of FormMonkey.

Core Tasks:
- Show formatted preview of final document (PDF inline viewer)
- Let user export as PDF/DOCX or send to e-sign
- Include checkboxes for terms/disclaimer gating
- Display confirmation or error state for export actions

This is a critical trust zone. UX must reinforce confidence in output quality.
