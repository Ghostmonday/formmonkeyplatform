"""
Claude, this is the FastAPI application entry point for FormMonkey's legal document processing platform.

Core Responsibilities:
- Bootstrap FastAPI application with production-ready configuration
- Mount modular routers: upload, parse, profile, export with proper prefixing
- Configure security middleware (CORS, rate limiting, request logging)
- Implement comprehensive error handling with privacy-safe error responses
- Add health monitoring endpoints (/ping, /health, /metrics)
- Setup request/response logging with PII redaction
- Configure dependency injection for shared services (database, AI models, storage)

Dependencies & Integration:
- Import from config.py: get_settings() for environment configuration
- Import routers: upload, parse, profile, export from routers/ directory
- Import shared/constants.ts for API route constants and error codes
- Import compliance/audit_log.py for request logging middleware
- Import auth/auth_utils.py for authentication middleware setup
- Coordinate with storage/storage_service.py for file cleanup background tasks

Architecture Principles:
- Modular design: Each router operates independently with clear boundaries
- Privacy-first: All logging and error responses must redact sensitive data
- Scalable: Support horizontal scaling with stateless design
- Secure: Implement proper authentication, authorization, and input validation
- Observable: Comprehensive monitoring and audit trail capabilities
- Compliant: Respect data retention policies and regulatory requirements

This entry point should remain lightweight, delegating business logic to appropriate services and routers.
