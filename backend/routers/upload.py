"""
Claude, implement the document upload router for FormMonkey's legal document processing pipeline.

Core Endpoints:
- POST /upload: Accept legal documents (PDF, DOCX, images) with comprehensive validation
- GET /upload/{job_id}/status: Real-time job status and progress tracking
- DELETE /upload/{job_id}: Cancel upload job and cleanup resources

Dependencies & Integration:
- Import config.py for file size limits, allowed types, and storage settings
- Call services/parser_engine.py.process_document() for document analysis
- Trigger services/ai_assistance.py.analyze_document() for semantic processing
- Use services/storage_service.py for secure file storage and cleanup
- Import shared/types.ts for JobStatus and FieldType interfaces
- Import shared/validators.ts for file validation functions
- Call compliance/audit_log.py.log_upload_event() for audit trails
- Use auth/auth_utils.py for user authentication and authorization

Upload Pipeline:
- Multi-format file validation (type, size, structure, content safety)
- Secure file storage with virus scanning and content analysis
- Asynchronous job orchestration (parser_engine → ai_assistance → storage)
- Progress tracking with granular status updates
- Error handling with user-friendly messages and retry mechanisms

Security & Privacy:
- File content sanitization and malware detection
- Temporary storage with automatic cleanup policies
- Upload rate limiting and size quotas per user
- Audit logging of all upload activities with PII redaction
- Secure file naming and path traversal prevention

API Design:
- RESTful endpoints with proper HTTP status codes
- Comprehensive request/response models using Pydantic
- Async/await patterns for non-blocking operations
- Graceful error handling with structured error responses
- OpenAPI documentation with clear examples

This router should remain stateless and delegate all business logic to appropriate services.
