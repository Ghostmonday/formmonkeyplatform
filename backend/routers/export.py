"""
Claude, implement the document export and finalization router for FormMonkey's output generation system.

Core Endpoints:
- POST /export/pdf: Generate high-fidelity PDF with filled fields and legal formatting
- POST /export/docx: Create editable Word documents with proper template preservation
- POST /export/sign: Initiate e-signature workflows with DocuSign/HelloSign integration
- GET /export/{job_id}/status: Real-time export progress and download readiness
- GET /export/{job_id}/download: Secure document download with access controls
- POST /export/batch: Bundle multiple documents for bulk processing
- GET /export/history: User's export history with metadata and re-download options

Dependencies & Integration:
- Primary service: services/export_service.py for all document generation logic
- Import services/parser_engine.py.get_field_positions() for layout preservation
- Use services/master_profile.py.get_signature_info() for signature block data
- Call export/docx_exporter.py and export/pdf_exporter.py for format-specific generation
- Import export/signing_integration.py for e-signature provider APIs
- Use shared/types.ts for export job status and document metadata
- Call compliance/audit_log.py.log_export_event() for regulatory compliance
- Import auth/auth_utils.py for download authorization and access controls
- Use config.py for provider API keys and export quality settings

Export Intelligence:
- Smart document formatting preservation with layout integrity
- Legal-specific output optimizations (signature blocks, clause formatting, compliance headers)
- Multi-format output with consistent field population and styling
- Template-aware generation respecting original document structure
- Watermarking and metadata embedding for document provenance

E-Signature Integration:
- Multi-provider support (DocuSign, HelloSign, Adobe Sign) with fallback mechanisms
- Intelligent signature field detection and routing
- Real-time signing status updates and completion notifications
- Compliance tracking with legal validity verification
- Support for complex signing workflows (multiple parties, sequential signing)

Security & Compliance:
- Document integrity verification with digital signatures and checksums
- Access control with time-limited download URLs and user authentication
- Audit logging for all export activities with compliance reporting
- Data retention policies with automatic cleanup of temporary files
- Export permission validation based on user roles and document sensitivity

This router orchestrates the complete document finalization pipeline while delegating all generation logic to the export_service.
