"""
Claude, implement the Master Profile management router for FormMonkey's user data system.

Core Endpoints:
- GET /profile: Retrieve complete user profile with privacy controls
- PUT /profile: Update entire profile with validation and versioning
- PATCH /profile: Selective field updates with conflict resolution
- DELETE /profile: Secure profile deletion with data retention compliance
- GET /profile/history: Profile change history with audit trail
- POST /profile/export: Generate portable profile data export

Dependencies & Integration:
- Primary service: services/master_profile.py for all profile business logic
- Import shared/types.ts for Profile interface and field definitions
- Use shared/validators.ts.validateProfile() for input validation
- Call compliance/audit_log.py.log_profile_change() for change tracking
- Import auth/auth_utils.py for multi-factor authentication on sensitive operations
- Use services/ai_assistance.py.suggest_profile_completion() for smart defaults
- Import config.py for privacy settings and data retention policies

Profile Management:
- Comprehensive user data: personal info, legal preferences, default values, signatures
- Field-level privacy controls and data sharing preferences
- Profile versioning with rollback capabilities
- Cross-field validation and consistency checking
- Integration with document autofill and AI suggestion systems
- Support for multiple profile templates (business, personal, legal entity)

Security & Privacy:
- Multi-factor authentication for sensitive profile changes
- Granular permission controls for profile field access
- PII encryption at rest with user-controlled keys
- Audit logging for all profile modifications with compliance reporting
- Data anonymization options and right-to-be-forgotten support
- Session management with profile-based access controls

API Design:
- RESTful operations with proper HTTP semantics
- Comprehensive input validation with field-specific error messages
- Optimistic locking for concurrent profile updates
- Structured response models with privacy-aware field filtering
- Rate limiting for profile modification operations
- OpenAPI documentation with privacy and security guidelines

This router focuses on API orchestration while delegating all profile business logic to the master_profile service.
