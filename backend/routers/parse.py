"""
Claude, implement the document parsing router for FormMonkey's legal document intelligence system.

Core Endpoints:
- GET /parse/{job_id}/fields: Retrieve parsed field data with AI-enhanced semantic context
- GET /parse/{job_id}/status: Real-time parsing progress and processing stages
- POST /parse/{job_id}/validate: Validate and refine parsed fields with user corrections
- GET /parse/{job_id}/preview: Generate structured preview data for frontend rendering

Dependencies & Integration:
- Call services/parser_engine.py.get_parsed_fields() for document structure data
- Use services/ai_assistance.py.enhance_field_context() for semantic enrichment
- Import services/master_profile.py.get_profile_defaults() for autofill suggestions
- Use shared/types.ts for ParsedField, FieldType, and JobStatus interfaces
- Import shared/validators.ts for field validation and business rules
- Call compliance/audit_log.py.log_parsing_event() for audit trails
- Use auth/auth_utils.py for user session and permission validation

Parsing Intelligence:
- Coordinate with parser_engine for document structure extraction
- Integrate ai_assistance for semantic field classification and relationship mapping
- Return comprehensive field data: labels, values, types, confidence scores, bounding boxes
- Provide document hierarchy understanding (sections, clauses, tables, signatures)
- Support for complex legal document structures (contracts, forms, agreements)

Response Structure:
- Structured JSON with nested field relationships and dependencies
- Confidence indicators for AI-suggested values and classifications
- Alternative suggestions with reasoning for ambiguous fields
- Document metadata (type, jurisdiction hints, compliance flags)
- Error contexts with specific field-level validation messages

Privacy & Performance:
- Stream large document results with pagination support
- Cache frequently accessed parsing results with TTL policies
- Redact sensitive field values in logs and error responses
- Support for incremental parsing updates as user makes corrections
- Audit trail for all parsing operations and field modifications

This router orchestrates parsing workflows while delegating all parsing logic to specialized services.
