"""
Claude, implement the Master Profile service for FormMonkey's comprehensive user data management system.

Profile Data Management:
- Comprehensive user profiles: personal info, business details, legal preferences, default values
- Multi-tier profile support: individual, business entity, legal representative profiles
- Profile templates and inheritance for common use cases (attorney, business owner, etc.)
- Field-level privacy controls and data sharing preferences
- Profile versioning with change history and rollback capabilities
- Custom field definitions for specialized legal practice areas

Dependencies & Integration:
- Import config.py for database connection settings and privacy configuration
- Use shared/types.ts for Profile interface and field type definitions
- Import shared/validators.ts.validateProfile() for comprehensive profile validation
- Called by routers/profile.py for all profile CRUD operations
- Used by routers/parse.py.get_profile_defaults() for document autofill
- Integrates with services/ai_assistance.py.suggest_profile_completion() for smart defaults
- Calls compliance/audit_log.py.log_profile_change() for change tracking
- Uses storage/storage_service.py for profile data persistence and backup

Data Operations:
- CRUD operations with atomic transactions and optimistic locking
- Selective field updates with conflict resolution and merge strategies
- Bulk operations for profile migration and administrative updates
- Profile validation with legal-specific business rules and cross-field dependencies
- Data export/import with multiple format support (JSON, CSV, legal XML standards)
- Profile archival and deletion with compliance-aware data retention

Security & Privacy:
- Field-level encryption for sensitive PII with user-controlled keys
- Access control with role-based permissions and audit trails
- Data anonymization and pseudonymization capabilities
- Right-to-be-forgotten implementation with dependency tracking
- Secure profile sharing with time-limited access tokens
- Multi-factor authentication integration for sensitive profile operations

Integration & Intelligence:
- Seamless integration with document parsing for intelligent field population
- AI-powered profile completion suggestions with confidence scoring
- Real-time validation using shared validator functions and legal business rules
- Event-driven updates to dependent systems (templates, AI models, compliance systems)
- API integration for third-party data sources (address validation, business registries)
- Smart defaults based on jurisdiction, practice area, and user patterns

Performance & Scalability:
- Lazy loading for large profile datasets with pagination support
- Profile caching with intelligent invalidation strategies
- Concurrent access handling with distributed locking mechanisms
- Bulk processing capabilities for administrative operations
- Performance monitoring and optimization recommendations
