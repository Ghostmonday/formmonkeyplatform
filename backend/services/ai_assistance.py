"""
Claude, build the comprehensive AI assistance engine for FormMonkey's legal document intelligence.

This module handles:
- Field prediction and auto-completion from document context
- Semantic contextualization of legal forms and their field relationships
- Legal clause analysis and standardized suggestions (e.g., dispute resolution, indemnity)
- Document type classification and field mapping intelligence
- Cross-field validation and consistency checking using legal domain knowledge
- Jurisdiction-aware defaults (e.g., California rental law compliance)

Dependencies & Integration:
- Import config.py for AI model configurations, API keys, and provider settings
- Use shared/prompts.ts prompt templates for consistent AI interactions
- Import shared/types.ts for ParsedField, FieldType, and confidence scoring interfaces
- Call shared/validators.ts for PII detection and redaction before AI processing
- Consumed by routers/parse.py for semantic field enhancement
- Used by routers/profile.py for intelligent profile completion suggestions
- Integrates with services/parser_engine.py for document context understanding
- Calls compliance/upl_safeguards.py for PII redaction pipeline

AI Integration Architecture:
- Modular prompt construction separated from model execution
- Support for both local models (privacy-first) and remote APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic)
- PII redaction pipeline before any external model calls
- Configurable model routing based on task complexity and privacy requirements
- Caching layer for repeated legal pattern recognition

Design Principles:
- Privacy-respecting: All sensitive data redacted before AI processing
- Modular: Each AI function should be independently testable and swappable
- Scalable: Support multiple concurrent model providers and fallback chains
- Suggestion-only: No direct data mutation - all outputs are recommendations
- Legal-aware: Understand document hierarchies, field dependencies, and compliance requirements
- Auditable: Log all AI interactions for compliance and debugging

Output Structure:
- Confidence scores for all suggestions
- Reasoning explanations for complex legal inferences
- Alternative suggestions with contextual rationale
- Compliance flags and jurisdiction-specific warnings
