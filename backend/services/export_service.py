"""
Claude, implement the comprehensive document export service for FormMonkey's finalization and delivery pipeline.

Document Generation:
- High-fidelity PDF generation with precise field placement and legal formatting standards
- Native DOCX creation with template preservation and editable field support
- Multi-format output with consistent field population and document integrity
- Smart layout optimization for different document types and form factors
- Template-aware generation respecting original document structure and styling
- Custom formatting rules for legal document types (contracts, forms, court documents)

Dependencies & Integration:
- Import config.py for export quality settings, provider API keys, and output paths
- Use export/pdf_exporter.py and export/docx_exporter.py for format-specific generation
- Call export/signing_integration.py for e-signature provider API integration
- Import services/parser_engine.py.get_field_positions() for layout preservation
- Use services/master_profile.py.get_signature_info() for signature data
- Called by routers/export.py for all document generation requests
- Import shared/types.ts for export job status and document metadata interfaces
- Calls compliance/audit_log.py.log_export_event() for compliance tracking
- Uses storage/storage_service.py for temporary file management and cleanup

Content Processing:
- Intelligent field filling with type-aware formatting (dates, currency, addresses)
- Legal-specific content enhancement (proper clause formatting, signature blocks)
- Document assembly from multiple sources with content merging and conflict resolution
- Watermarking and metadata embedding for document provenance and authenticity
- Content validation and error detection before finalization
- Support for conditional content based on field values and document logic

E-Signature Integration:
- Multi-provider support: DocuSign, HelloSign, Adobe Sign with intelligent routing
- Automated signature field detection and placement optimization
- Complex workflow orchestration (sequential signing, parallel approvals, conditional routing)
- Real-time status tracking with webhook integration and event notifications
- Compliance verification with legal validity checks and audit trail generation
- Template-based signing configurations for common document types

Performance & Scalability:
- Asynchronous processing with job queuing and progress tracking
- Streaming generation for large documents with memory optimization
- Caching strategies for templates, configurations, and frequently used assets
- Batch processing capabilities for high-volume scenarios
- Resource pooling and optimization for concurrent export operations
- Progressive enhancement with configurable quality/speed trade-offs

Security & Compliance:
- Document integrity verification with digital signatures and checksums
- Access control integration with time-limited URLs and authentication
- Comprehensive audit logging with compliance reporting capabilities
- Data minimization with automatic cleanup of temporary files and processing artifacts
- Encryption at rest and in transit with key management integration
- Privacy-preserving processing with optional on-premises deployment

Architecture:
- Plugin-based system for different output formats and providers
- Event-driven processing with real-time status updates
- Modular design supporting custom export workflows and business rules
- Horizontally scalable with distributed processing capabilities
