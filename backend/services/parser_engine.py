"""
Claude, implement the core document parsing engine for FormMonkey's legal document intelligence system.

Document Processing Pipeline:
- Multi-format parsing: PDF (text/image), DOCX, images, scanned documents
- Intelligent OCR with legal document optimization (Tesseract, cloud OCR APIs)
- Document structure analysis: headers, sections, tables, signature blocks, form fields
- Text extraction with layout preservation and coordinate mapping
- Content classification by document type (contract, form, agreement, etc.)

Dependencies & Integration:
- Import config.py for OCR model paths, processing limits, and quality settings
- Use parser/ocr_utils.py for OCR processing and image enhancement
- Call parser/parser_service.py for document structure analysis
- Import shared/types.ts for ParsedField and FieldType definitions
- Used by routers/upload.py.process_document() for initial document analysis
- Called by routers/parse.py.get_parsed_fields() for field extraction
- Integrates with services/ai_assistance.py for semantic field enhancement
- Calls storage/storage_service.py for temporary file management during processing

Semantic Field Detection:
- Legal field taxonomy: parties, dates, amounts, terms, clauses, obligations
- Pattern recognition for common legal constructs (whereas clauses, definitions, schedules)
- Form field identification: checkboxes, text inputs, dropdowns, signature areas
- Table parsing with column/row semantic understanding
- Cross-reference detection (defined terms, section references, exhibits)

Advanced Document Understanding:
- Legal clause classification and standardization
- Jurisdiction and law type detection (state, federal, international)
- Document hierarchy mapping (main agreement, schedules, amendments)
- Template recognition and field mapping for known document types
- Content validation against legal document standards

AI Integration:
- Modular AI model integration for semantic enhancement
- Local model support for privacy-sensitive documents
- Confidence scoring for all extracted elements
- Alternative interpretation suggestions for ambiguous content
- Context-aware field relationship mapping

Architecture:
- Plugin-based parsing system for different document types
- Scalable processing with job queuing and progress tracking
- Caching layer for repeated document structure patterns
- Error handling with detailed diagnostic information
- Performance optimization with incremental processing capabilities

Output Format:
- Structured document representation with semantic annotations
- Field extraction results with confidence scores and bounding boxes
- Document metadata with classification and quality metrics
- Error reporting with specific location context and suggested corrections
